<h3 id="background-note-on-cyber-crime">Background Note on Cyber Crime</h3>
<p>It is increasingly felt that action must be taken to prevent cyber-bullying and trolling in order to make platforms safer for marginalized communities to safely represent their points of view.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-online-violenceonline-abuse">What is online violence/online abuse?</h3>
<p>There are several kinds of harassment and abuse that people face on the internet. Online violence and abuse can take many forms. The following are some forms of online violence:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threats of violence</strong>: Direct and indirect threats of physical or sexual violence.</li>
<li><strong>Violations of privacy</strong>: Sharing of sexual and private images without consent, and ‘doxxing’ (revealing personal or identifying details without consent, with the aim to cause distress).</li>
<li><strong>Discrimination</strong>: Targeted content that is sexist, racist, homophobic or related to an individual’s identity that aims to belittle, humiliate or undermine them.</li>
<li><strong>Online harassment</strong>: Sustained or repeated communications involving one or more people working together to target an individual, using abusive comments or images online, over a short or coordinated period of time, with the aim of humiliating or otherwise distressing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember that online settings where such violence can occur include but are not limited to social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

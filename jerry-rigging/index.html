A &ldquo;jury mast,&rdquo; for example, was a temporary replacement mast put up after the original was lost in an emergency. This term emphasizes clever, temporary improvisation with limited materials to restore function.</p><p><strong>Jerry-built</strong>: This term, from the 19th century, describes something that is cheaply and flimsily built using poor materials. It implies a lack of quality and care in construction, not necessarily a temporary fix.</p><h2 id=example-thallumala-theater-fight-scene id=example-thallumala-theater-fight-scene>Example: Thallumala Theater Fight Scene

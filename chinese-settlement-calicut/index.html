It&rsquo;s a fascinating piece of Kerala&rsquo;s maritime history that&rsquo;s often overlooked.</p><p>During the reign of the Ming emperors, massive Chinese vessels regularly visited Kozhikode (Calicut). Thousands of Chinese soldiers lived in Calicut, and they left behind a half Chinese half-Malayali community called <strong>Chinna Kribala</strong>.</p><p>Even after the arrival of the Chinese ceased, this lineage of mixed Malayali and Chinese heritage remained in Kozhikode. <strong>Chinali</strong>, the famous pirate and sailor, was born into this lineage.</p><h2 id=archaeological-evidence id=archaeological-evidence>Archaeological Evidence

According to Dr. Raghava Varier (who was a member of the Karashima team) this medieval port was the main ship repair centre and all Chinese ships had to dock here. He explains that during test digging in Elayedath paramba and Illath paramba in Panthalayani Kollom, he obtained Chinese ceramic sherds at a depth of 1 metre. Taisho University Press has published the findings of Karashima in 2004. Incidentally, Karashima identifies the Chinese Gulifo with Panthalayini Kollom (and not Calicut, as some of us had erroneously assumed).</p></blockquote><p>The findings were published by Taisho University Press in 2004.</p><h2 id=related-concepts id=related-concepts>Related Concepts
